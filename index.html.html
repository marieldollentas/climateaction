        <h1>About the Advocacy</h1>
        <p>This advocacy seeks to <b>protect the natural resources and environment of the Philippines,</b> especially in the face of reclamation projects that could have far-reaching and detrimental effects on the safety and well-being of the youth and the broader community. It calls for a more balanced and sustainable approach to coastal development and urges decision-makers to take into account the environmental and safety concerns associated with these projects.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="about-the-advocacy-col">
                <h3>Issues</h3>
                <p>The advocacy in question is primarily concerned with raising awareness and taking action against current land reclamation projects, which are altering the coastal and shoreline areas in the Philippines. These projects have significant environmental and safety implications. The advocates highlight several issues, including <b>(a.) increased risk of flooding and erosion,</b> particularly in areas susceptible to natural disasters such as typhoons and storm surges which can disrupt the natural flow of water and exacerbate flooding in coastal communities;<b> (b.) vulnerability to earthquakes and liquefaction</b> which poses a significant safety concern for people residing in or near these reclaimed zones; and <b>(c.) youth concerns</b> as the advocacy emphasizes that the youth of the Philippines will bear the long-term consequences of these reclamation projects.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-the-advocacy-col">
                <h3>Objectives</h3>
                <p>The Filipino youth are uniting against coastal reclamation projects, demanding change from government agencies. Their key demands, amid the growing climate crisis, are as follows: <b>(a.) involve the youth in decision-making</b> as they argue that their generation will bear the long-term consequences of these projects, and thus, they have the right to participate in shaping their future; <b>(b.) halting reclamation and dredging</b> due to their significant threat to marine ecosystems and the livelihoods of fisherfolk, and urge the government to prioritize environmental protection and people's interests over corporate profits; and <b>(c.) reallocating funds for pro-people adaptation</b> which involves supporting innovative approaches developed by young people, including renewable energy sources, sustainable fishing practices, and green infrastructure. In essence, this movement spearheaded by Filipino youth aims to ensure that coastal development and adaptation prioritize people's well-being and environmental sustainability over profit, particularly in the face of escalating climate challenges.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-the-advocacy-col">
                <h3>Why is This Important?</h3>
                <p>The Philippines, blessed with one of the world's longest coastlines at approximately 36,289 kilometers, faces a pressing threat from numerous reclamation activities, including dredging and dump-and-fill projects. Currently, there are over 180 proposed and ongoing reclamation projects in the country. These coastal reclamation endeavors have brought about adverse effects on marine ecosystems and the livelihoods of fishing communities. They have resulted in the destruction of critical habitats like coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds, and wetlands, disrupting fish migration patterns and depleting fish stocks, thereby reducing the income of fisherfolk. Furthermore, these reclamation projects have amplified the risks of flooding and erosion, particularly in areas prone to natural disasters such as typhoons and storm surges. The locations of these developments are susceptible to ground shaking and liquefaction, which pose significant concerns for people's safety during earthquakes and flooding events. Considering that the youth of the Philippines will bear the long-term consequences of these projects, there is a strong call for their voices to be heard in the decision-making processes. This collective effort aims to defend and protect the nation's precious natural resources, recognizing that the youth are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of these reclamation activities.</p>

        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>Amidst the ceaseless march of time and the relentless transformations of the modern world, a specter looms ever larger, casting its shadow over the collective conscience of humanity. It is a specter not of supernatural origin but a phenomenon deeply rooted in reality—the specter of climate change. As the Earth's climate shifts, it sparks a cascade of interconnected social issues, and among them, the contentious realm of land reclamation emerges as a central figure in this unfolding drama.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 1: MASID-DANAS</h3>
                <p>Recently, as I was scrolling through my phone, I noticed that the news was all about dead aquatic organisms, such as turtles, dolphins, coral reefs, and many more. That news shattered me into pieces knowing that they don’t have enough protection from harmful things that they have and might experience from this world. As a result, I decided to gather more knowledge about it,  making me an aware individual who wants to do something for a change.<br>For instance, Manila Bay has long been recognized as the entry point for the socioeconomic growth of the Philippines since it allows trade and commerce between the city and its neighbors through its natural port feature. To increase the amount of land available in the thriving metropolis of Manila, a significant reclamation project has been underway along a significant portion of its coastline for the past 40 years. The project's size will undoubtedly expand commercial prospects, create thousands of employment locally, spur the creation of appealing real estate projects, boost government revenue, and restore Manila's former status as a top business and tourism destination. Although these initiatives have improved the economy and infrastructure, numerous civic, religious, and environmental groups have been vocally opposed to them. The ecology, according to protesters, is not being considered in these schemes. These initiatives, which have the strong backing of local leaders, put financial gain ahead of social and environmental preservation. The public sector has less influence over land development than the private sector in this instance, which is similar to the flimsy influence of citizen engagement on the decision-making process. Unfortunately, it seems that despite the objections, further reclamation projects are being built along this coastal megacity.<br>It is still crucial to be aware of the certain effects of land reclamation, so that we, people, can somehow do something to help the environmentalists save nature. The National Reclamation Plan's reclamation of more than 38,000 hectares will result in the loss of an equivalent amount of seagrass, spawning grounds, and aquatic life's habitat, which will result in an annual loss of 4.7 billion invertebrates and 3.78 trillion fish. Aside from that, the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority's (Namria) physical oceanography section discovered that between 1901 and 2022, the sea level in Metro Manila rose by an average of 8.4 millimeters per year, more than three times the global average of 3.4 mm/year.<br>The rise in the water level in the bay, which results in significant flooding and storm surges, is also a result of reclaimed lands. In addition to having a negative impact on people's quality of life, they also run the risk of halting local economic activity, especially in low-lying communities. The fragility of our cities, the disruption of ecosystems, and the loss of biodiversity are actually made worse by these catastrophes. The systems that sustain all life on Earth, including humans, depend on biodiversity. We cannot have the healthy ecosystems that we depend on to give us the air we breathe and the food we consume without a diverse variety of animals, plants, and microorganisms. We, people also have to appreciate nature in and of itself.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 2: SURI-NILAY</h3>
                <p>Much of the change that is being done or promoted on news platforms and social media is drastic and requires a hefty amount of resources and time for the efforts to finally bear fruit. The small steps that are being undertaken by groups of people who genuinely advocate for a certain cause often go unnoticed due to the fact that the results are not flashy enough or cannot have a stellar headline attached to them.<br>The petition that we signed does not only pave the way for the Filipino youth to reclaim their rights to create sustainable solutions to protect oceans and coastlines, but it also marks the beginning of shaping us into becoming an advocate within our own means. We are often discouraged from committing to change because the capabilities of an average student alone do not suffice in a fight against, say, for example, climate change.<br>However, there is strength in numbers, and when banded together creates an immovable force that dares challenge those who oppose it and the projects that do not align with their cause. This is the objective of petitions, to entice people with a mutual interest in changing something for the better to share in a collective action. There is nothing more powerful than the Filipino youth upholding their stand against projects that we deem harmful for sectors of people and places, simply because we are the ones who take the fall when the consequences start to show themselves in the near future.<br>The Filipino youth's stand against reclamation projects reflects a resounding call for responsible and sustainable coastal development. Their demands for youth involvement in decision-making, a halt to ongoing projects, and a shift towards pro-people adaptation embody a vision of a future where the environment and communities thrive in harmony. By advocating for these changes, the youth are not only safeguarding their own interests but also contributing to a legacy of environmental stewardship for generations to come. It is imperative that these voices are acknowledged and heeded, for they represent a powerful force in the pursuit of a more sustainable and inclusive future for the Philippines.<br>When you think about it, we care even when and where it does not affect us directly. We care when the reclamation projects that want to create bigger plots of land should not put the livelihood of fisherfolk at stake. We are concerned when the habitats of marine life are destroyed in the name of “coastal development” and disguised as such instead of it being described as its true nature—a reckless obsession with territory.<br>Signing our names on a petition does not absolve me of any guilt I feel whenever I recall times when I failed to be a steward of the environment.<br>"Minsan lang naman eh.”<br>Sometimes, a word meaning occasionally rather than all the time. Where is the harm in doing something sometimes? Our carbon footprints are not at the scale of corporations who release far more waste in the air that we breathe, the water that we drink, and the land we walk on than we will ever do in our lifetime. You do not become the main contributor to climate change by throwing your trash in the wrong bin. Not until you put things into perspective and begin to open your eyes to the scale of what is happening. Our ignorance through omitting from being a proponent of change will be at the expense of the environment. This is what pushed us to reflect on the positive effect that will be brought about by starting with a petition.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 3: TAYA-KILOS</h3>
                <p>We believe that big changes start with small steps. It starts with a very simple decision one can make in their everyday lives. Gradually, these small steps result in progress, building up slowly and steadily through time. It may not be perfect, and it may not be fast. But, 1% is enough to protect and nurture the Earth – To develop something that we can give the next generations. That one tiny percentage that everyone in the world can contribute is enough to build something larger we would never expect. Something boundless that will last longer than anyone can perceive.<br>That 1% you can personally give, of course, is only possible if we focus less on the towering fear and bigger problems, and focus more on our tiny actions and simple decisions. However, we are not saying that you are not allowed to feel fear and anxiety about what might happen to our home. It is very respectable for a person to be aware, knowledgeable, and open-minded about their surroundings. To be accepting of the truth is something that is not easily learned. Nonetheless, we must not limit ourselves to just being aware and informed. Let us use our potential and skills that God gave us to do something about it, and it always starts with something small.<br>But what are these “small steps” that we keep talking about? It can always start everywhere and anywhere you want. You can achieve these small steps inside your house. Some of these can be by throwing your trash in the right bin or by utilizing the 3Rs – Reuse, Reduce, Recycle. These actions do not take too much of your energy but it significantly helps. By consistently adopting these simple habits, you are now on the correct path to making that 1%. There are many other ways, and we must not hold ourselves back from thinking of other ways to achieve that percentage. We can always make use of the internet and the social media and put it to good use. With the wide array of software, applications, and websites that are available out there, we sure can find ways to help Mother Nature. A small step includes signing petitions, using eco-friendly apps and engines (e.g. Ecosia), and supporting online advocacy groups. Not only does sharing informative posts and showing our support and sincerity with other people help us make a change, but it also motivates other people like our friends and family, to be a part of the change. It does not take a lot of effort and energy to motivate other people to contribute their 1%. This simply can be done by showing them that you support protecting our planet and being sincere and committed to it. A good deed of one inspires other people to do the same thing – which is why projects and organizations exist. These events and projects aim to gather volunteers who are also inspired to make a change. Another small step we can make is by joining these projects: Planting trees projects, seminars to enhance our knowledge, events, volunteer work, and many more. Not only that it supports a movement to keep going, but we can also develop new connections and relationships with people with the same aspiration as you have. Finally, one of the actions that we can take is, if you are starting to become aware that the products you use can be dangerous to our environment, we can always find good alternatives that are 100% eco-friendly in the market.<br>These are just some of the suggestions we can give for everyone to have a starting point. Remember, achieving our goal can be done in many different, simple, and creative ways. It does not have to be complicated at first. By being consistent and committed, these simple habits can lead to much bigger ones that someday may influence more and many people to have the same vision and mission as you. Again, big changes start with small steps.</p>
